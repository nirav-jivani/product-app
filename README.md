## Building

To build the project run:

ng build

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use the following command:

ng test

---

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

ng e2e

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
